Canvas2d render implementatie:

TODO:

Save texture coords during addQuads as well.
Because they are also temporarily saved.

Colorizing images.

Fallback for corner gradients.

Patterns (repeating textures?): texture params.

Set image smoothing based on texture (if gl.NEAREST).

WebGL specific settings ($gl: {type: ...}, $c2d: {type: ...})

FastBlurComponent: two types:
- webgl
- canvas2d
  canvas2d uses the 'blur' filter.

Fix:
FlowingGradientShader

FastBlurShader fallback for canvas2d.
